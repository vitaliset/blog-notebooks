        "# Evaluating Ranking in Regression\n",
        "\n",
        "In supervised learning regression problems, the focus is generally on metrics that ensure the predicted value is close to the true value of the sample. Classic regression metrics are variations that involve the measure $| \\hat{y_i} - y_i |$.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, it is not always essential to predict the exact value of the target variable precisely, as in some applications, exactness is not critical to the final objective. In many cases, achieving a good ranking of the predictions is sufficient to meet the demands of the business problem. Of course, this depends on the context, but with proper ranking, we can approach the problem similarly to setting a [threshold in binary classification](https://vitaliset.github.io/threshold-dependent-opt/) or, more generally, as a policy problem. In this case, the most appropriate cutoff point is identified through additional analysis to implement a desired treatment or action, such as targeting individuals with an expected credit card expense greater than $\\delta$ for a new product marketing campaign. In most companies, the policy is structured around buckets of relevant percentiles, which are inherently based on ranking.\n",
        "\n",
        "In other scenarios, such as income estimation, the regression model is often used as an auxiliary variable in subsequent models. These models, frequently ensemble of decision trees, inherently disregard the exact value of variables, considering only their rankings. If the final model is, for instance, a logistic regression or even a neural network, simple transformations are typically applied, altering the distribution of the values but maintaining monotonicity. Again, the exact values matter much less than the ranking.\n",
        "\n",
        "From this perspective, it becomes clear that regression problems may require specific metrics to evaluate the quality of the ranking rather than relying solely on metrics that aim to minimize variations of $| \\hat{y_i} - y_i |$.\n",

Consequently, an initial idea might be to use Pearson's correlation. However, Pearson's correlation focuses solely on linear relationships and does not account for the relative order of the values. Thus, even if the model accurately reproduces the order of the predicted values, if the transformation between the values is not close to linear, Pearson's correlation may not adequately reflect the quality of the ranking.\n",

        "These metrics are quite useful, but if your regression problem is highly imbalanced, you may encounter some difficulties. I have worked on regression problems where over 99.5% of the data had values equal to 0, with only a small fraction having any associated value. Since many values will be tied, depending on the correlation implementation you use, your previous metrics may become artificially inflated or deflated, without a clear rationale to identify the issue. In the case of ROCAUC, with many ties in $y_i = y_j$, discarding numerous samples might result in a less reliable value with high variance.\n",

        "## Ranking Curve\n",
        "\n",
        "The ranking curve (I’m not sure if this curve has an official name) is interesting because it is very simple and intuitive. The process involves ranking your sample based on the predicted variable, dividing it into \"buckets\" according to percentiles, and then calculating the mean or another relevant positional statistic for each bucket. For example, if you divide the sample into 10 buckets, the third bucket would contain the elements with values falling between the 20th and 30th percentiles, and you would compute the mean of these values.\n",
        "\n",
        "The idea is that, if your score ranks the sample well, then the elements with the highest values will cluster at one end, and those with the lowest values will cluster at the other. As a result, the resulting graph will have a steep slope.\n",
        "\n",
        "$\\oint$ _I usually divide the buckets into 10, but this number is a parameter you can adjust as desired, depending on the level of detail you want to observe. The issue is that the greater the detail, the noisier the result will be due to smaller sample sizes. However, by using a bootstrap method, you can plot a confidence interval for analysis._\n",
        "\n",
        "$\\oint$ _This construction is not a [QQ-plot](https://vitaliset.github.io/covariate-shift-1-qqplot/), but understanding how a QQ-plot works may help you grasp the construction of this metric, even though this curve is much simpler._"

        "\n",
        "Although regression models often optimize metrics based on $\\hat{y_i} - y_i |$, I hope this discussion has inspired reflection on the limitations of such metrics. They may not always be the most appropriate choice and can sometimes obscure the true problem of interest.\n",
        "\n",
        "The ranking metrics introduced here each provide are highly valuable, complementing one another depending on the specific context and problem at hand. Instead of striving for a single, universally applicable metric, it is often more effective to evaluate these metrics collectively. In practice, they tend to align and reinforce each other, offering a richer and more nuanced understanding of model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, I encourage you to tweak existing metrics or develop custom variations which can often uncover fresh perspectives on a problem. The ultimate goal is not merely to assign a score to a model but to ensure it aligns with the problem's objectives and delivers outcomes that are meaningful and actionable.\n",
        "\n",
        "$\\oint$ _It is worth emphasizing that ranking-oriented metrics are especially relevant in domains like recommendation systems, where the primary objective is to provide an optimal ranking of items rather than precise predictions. By focusing on ranking quality, these metrics address the practical requirements of systems designed to prioritize user preferences and deliver highly relevant outcomes efficiently. I believe that adaptations of such metrics could also be highly effective for addressing the challenges in other domains._\n",
