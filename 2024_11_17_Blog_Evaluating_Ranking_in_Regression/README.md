# Blog: Evaluating ranking in regression

Classical regression metrics are not always useful when we are more interested in ranking than in the exact prediction values. Here, we discuss some approaches to evaluate ranking problems.

## Installing the enviroment for the blog notebook (AKA having reproducible results)

Once you are inside this folder, you can install the libraries I'm using with poetry as follows:
```console
poetry install
```

We can then launch the jupyter notebook:
```console
poetry run jupyter notebook
```
